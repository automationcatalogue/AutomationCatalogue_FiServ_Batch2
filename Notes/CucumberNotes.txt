1. TDD --> Test Driven Development --> JUnit & TestNG
2. BDD --> Behavioural Driven Development --> JBehave & Cucumber

==> Both are used to maintain the Oragnizing the TestCases management

==> TestCases management will be done throught Annotation
==> Annotations will be started with "@" symbol

TDD --> TestNG -->https://testng.org/doc/ --> Click on Documentation to all annotations
BDD --> Cucumber --> https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/

1. Feature files
2. Step Definitions
3. Cucumber Runner Options

==> In BDD, Gherkin language is used to develop the Scenarios
==> These Gherking language is implemented with Gherkin keywords
	Few Gherkin Keywords: Given, When, Then, And, But, As 
	
	By using these Gherking keywords, we are going to build the feature file scenarios
	
	

						CUCUMBER - BDD Framework
JUnit/TestNG is a TDD (Test Driven Development) framework
Cucumber is a BDD (Behavioural Driven Development) framework

In BDD, behaviour of a test case/ use case is going to define.
Gherkin is the language used to define the BDD framework

To achieve the BDD, either Cucumber/JBehave (Java Behave) can be used.
JBehave -BDD is bit complex compared to Cucumber, that is the reason most of the organizations implement the BDD with cucumber.

Cucumber with Java (JVM) & Cucumber with ruby is available
BDD framework not only applicable for selenium automation, it can be used in development of the application code/writing the unit test cases/ web services automation / API automation etc.,

There are three components
1. feature files
2. stepDefinition files
3. Test Runner

"Please refer the BDD components.png"

feature files:
--------------
files will be saved with ".feature" extension and below are the Gherkin keywords used in feature file
	a) Given
	b) When
	c) Then
	d) And
	e) But
	f) As
	e) *

==> All these Gherkin keywords will be used as part of the scenario/scenario outline in a feature file.
==> A group of scenarios can be written as part of the feature file

stepDefinition files:
---------------------
In stepDefinition files, will write the actual implementation. i.e., Selenium + Java + Annotations

TestRunner:
-----------
TestRunner with Junit
TestRunner is used To run the feature file
			(OR)
	To generate the output (or) report
				   
Below are the Dependencies required:
------------------------------------
1. cucumber-java
2. cucumber-jvm
3. cucumber-junit
4. cucumber-jvm-deps
5. cucumber-reporting
6. Gherkin
7. Junit

Also add the required selenium dependencies for the automation

Plugins:
--------
1. Natural plugin should be installed in the eclipse for a good experience
	a) It should be installed through the eclipse market place. search as "Natural" and install the plugin.
	b) If Natural plugin is not listed in the search result, open the below URL
		https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/natural
		(OR) search in google as "Natural BDD plugin in eclipse" and open the above url.
	c) Drag and Drop the Install icon into the eclipse, eclipse will ask for the installation.
2) Install the Eclipse plugin for Cucumber from the eclipse marketplace

In Feature files:
------------------
1. Create the Feature and Scenario
2. Under the Scenario, define the Test steps using Gherkin keywords
3. Multiple Scenarios can be written under the same feature file
Example: 

	Feature: Profile Sign-In Scenario

	Scenario: profile sign-in scenario 
	Given application url is opened
	When user enters the username and password
	And click on Login button
	Then user should land on the logged in page

In StepDefinition files:
-------------------------
1. Write the implementation of a specific step
2. Write the annotation begins with @ symbol and inside the braces, 
	^ should be used before the actual step
	$ should be used after the actual step
	
Example:

	
	@Given("^application url is opened$")
	public void load_url(){
		//Code Implementation
	}
	
In TestRunner file:
-------------------
Write the below code before the starting the class, so that use cases can be executed with the help of Junit Test.

import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

import cucumber.api.CucumberOptions;
import cucumber.api.junit.Cucumber;

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
		features="<feature file path should be mentioned>",
		glue={"<stepDefinition package need to be mentioned>"},
		plugin={"pretty","html:test-output"}
		)

@RunWith is the Junit annotation --> That's reason able to run with the Run as Junit Test
==> features and glue are the arguments in CucumberOptions annotation
==> features value should be the path of feature files path
==> glue value should be the stepDefinition package name

==> plugin={"pretty","html:test-output"} --> This statement is used to generate the output in pretty format (it means more detailed info in the console and html file will be generated in the test-output folder)

==> Open the above generated cucumber report in the browser.

==> The disadvantage of BDD framework is, 
1. It's a lengthy behaviour
2. All the behaviour should be defined (so many Gherkin words and so many steps should be written)
 whereas in TDD actual code implementation can be written directly.
 
==> The Advantage of BDD framework is, anyone can contribute whoever having the application knowledge (like Business Analysts/Product Managers/Manual Testers/Dev Team/QA Team etc.,)

								CUCUMBER Options
Following are the different cucumber options available
a) features
b) glue
c) dryRun
d) tags
e) plugin
f) strict
g) monoChrome

features:
---------
Path of the feature files will be mentioned against to the features option. Cucumber will check for all the feature files from this location

Note: To provide multiple feature file paths, values should be separated with , (comma)
	  Ex: {"path1/abcd.feature","path2/xyz.feature"}
	  
glue:
-----
Path of the Step definitions will be mentioned against to the glue option. Cucumber will check for associated step definition code of each step from this location

Note: To provide multiple stepDefinition file paths, values should be separated with , (comma)
	  Ex: {"path1/abcd","path2/xyz"}

dryRun:
-------
==> dryRun value should be provided either true or false

==> If dryRun=true --> Cucumber will only checks the every step mentioned in the feature file has corresponding code in the step definition file or not. 
	• In case if any functions are missed in the step definition file for a step, cucumber will give us the message that step definitions are missed for actual steps
	
==> If dryRun=false --> Cucumber will not check whether every step having the corresponding code in the step definition file, Executes the feature files

Strict:
-------
==> Strict value should be provided either true or false
	 
==> If strict=true --> If Cucumber finds that any of the step is not having the corresponding code in the step definition file, undefined steps will be marked as Fail and Build is FAILURE

==> If strict=false --> If cucumber finds that any of the step is not having the corresponding code in the step definition, undefined steps will be skipped and Build is SUCCESSFUL

MonoChrome:
-----------
==> Monochrome value should be provided either true or false

==> If monochrome=true --> Console output of the cucumber tests are much more readable
==> If monochrome=false --> Console output of the cucumber tests is not readable as it should be 

plugin:
-------
==> This cucumber option "plugin" is used to generate the cucumber reports in various formats
==> plugin={"pretty","html:test-output",,"json:target/json-report","junit:target/cucumber-xml"}
	
	pretty is the one type of format to display the outline in the console with detailed steps
	html:test-output --> html report will be generated in the test-output folder
	json:target/json-report --> json-report will be generated in the target folder
	junit:target/cucumber-xml --> cucumber-xml will be generated in the target folder. (This is much readable report which steps are passed and which steps are failed)
	
	
					Data Driven Testing in Cucumber
==> Data Driven Testing in Cucumber can be achieved in '3' ways
1. Simple Data Driven - without Examples keyword
2. With Examples keyword + Scenario Outline
3. Using Data Tables

==> When Data Driven Testing is implemented, there is no need of hard coding the values in the scripts (i.e., in stepDefinition files), values can be passed from the feature files

1. Simple Data Driven - without Examples keyword:
-------------------------------------------------
==> Enter exact data in double quotation in the feature files like below
Example: 

	Feature: Profile Sign-In Scenario

	Scenario: sign-in scenario 
	Given application url is opened
	When user enters the "abcd@gmail.comm" and "Admin@123"
	And click on Login button
	Then user should land on the logged in page
	
Now go to the stepDefinition file and go to the specific method, write the method implementation like below using the special regular expression \"(.*)\"   or   \"([^\"]*)\"

Example:
	
	@When("^user enters the \"(.*)\" and \"(.*)\"$")
	public void login(String username, String password){
		----------
		----------
		----------
	}

==> Whenever you implement the above concept, very first time is always preferred to run the script with dryRun=true. Because if there is any problem in mapping between feature file and stepDefinition file will find.

2. With Examples keyword + Scenario Outline:
--------------------------------------------
==> If "Examples" keyword is using in the feature file, then that should be written under the "Scenario Outline" instead of Scenario

Q: What is the difference between Scenario and Scenario Outline?
A: Scenario Outline exactly same as Scenario, but only difference is the provision of multiple inputs.
	When Scenario outline is written, that all the steps of specific scenario will be executed multiple times with different sets of data based on Examples values.
	
Feature: Login - Profile Sign In Scenario

Scenario Outline: profile sign-in scenario 
Given application url is opened
When user enters the "<username>" and "<password>"
And click on Login button
Then user should land in the my-account home page
And close the browser

Examples: 
			| username                | password   |
			| sagarch.aaro@gmail.com  | Admin@123456 |
			| testabcd@gmail.com      | Test@1234  |

==> Here data which is used in Scenaro Outline exactly should match with examples data.

==> Whenever you implement the above concept, very first time is always preferred to run the script with dryRun=true. Because if there is any problem in mapping between feature file and stepDefinition file will find.

==> In Examples can give the multiple values from more than one step, like below

Feature: Login - Profile Sign In Scenario

Scenario Outline: profile sign-in scenario 
Given load the application url for "<environment>" environment
When user enters the "<username>" and "<password>"
And click on Login button
Then user should land in the my-account home page
And close the browser

Examples: 
			| username                | password     | environment |
			| sagarch.aaro@gmail.com  | Admin@123456 | stage       |
			| testabcd@gmail.com      | Test@1234    | test        |

3. Data Driven Testing Using Data Tables:
-----------------------------------------
==> Whenever any specific step needs to execute with different sets of TestData, we should go for
Data Tables concept in cucumber


@All @DemoWebShop
Feature: DemoWebShop Place Order with Multiple Items

  @DemoWebShop_PlaceOrder
  Scenario Outline: DemoWebShop PlaceOrder
    Given User is opened "chrome" browser
    Given User is opened "DemoWebShop" Application URL
    When User enters "<UserName>" and "<Password>" in DemoWebShop Application
    And User clicks on Login button in DemoWebShop Application
    Then User validates email address in DemoWebShop Application
    When User selects ProductCategory and added ProductName into Shopping Cart
          | ProductCategory | ProductName |
          | Books           | Computing and Internet |
          | Apparel & Shoes | Blue Jeans             |
          | Digital downloads | 3rd Album            |
    And User clicks on Shopping Cart link in DemoWebShop Application
    And User clicks on Checkout button by accepting terms
    And User place order with default configuration in DemoWebShop Application
    And User Logout from DemoWebShop Application

    Examples:
      | UserName | Password |
      | aarosagarch@gmail.com | Admin@123 |
      | GayathriTest@gmail.com | Test@123 |
      | Srinath@gmail.com | Admin@123 |

@When("User selects ProductCategory and added ProductName into Shopping Cart")
    public void user_selects_product_category_and_added_product_name_into_shopping_cart(DataTable dataTable) {
        WebDriver driver = BaseClass.getDriver();
        String productCategory = "", productName = "";
        List<Map<String, String>> list_TableData = dataTable.asMaps();
        for(Map<String, String> mapData:list_TableData){
            productCategory = mapData.get("ProductCategory");
            productName = mapData.get("ProductName");

            DemoWebShop_AddToCartPage.clickCategory(productCategory);
            driver.findElement(By.xpath("(//h2//a[text()='"+productName+"'])[1]/../..//input")).click();
            System.out.println(productName+ " is added into Shopping Cart");
        }
    }

Background Keyword:
-------------------
==> It is one of the Gherkin Keyword
==> Steps which are part of Background will be executed before scenario of a specific feature file
==> In general pre-requisites of scenario will be written in the Background

Cucumber Hooks:
--------------
==> Cucumber Hooks block of code will be executed before every scenario and after every scenario
==> There are '4' types of cucumber Hooks annotations are present
1. @Before
2. @After
3. @BeforeStep
4. @AfterStep


@Before:
-------
==> Before annotation block of code will be executed before executing every scenario of all feature files
==> In general, before annotation block of code will have pre-requisites of the scenario like
reading the TestData file, opening the Database connection, Initializing the Log file or Initializing reports etc.,

@After:
-------
==> After annotation block of code will be executed after executing every scenario of all feature files
==> In general, after annotation block of code will have tearDown() activities,
like closing a file, closing driver object, closing database connection/network connect etc.,
==> After annotation block of code will always execute whether scenario is passed/failed


@BeforeStep:
-----------
==> BeforeStep annotation block of code will be executed before every step of every scenario across
all feature file


@AfterStep:
----------
==> AfterStep annotation block of code will be executed after every step of every scenario across
    all feature files
    Example is: Capturing screenshots after every scenario step
