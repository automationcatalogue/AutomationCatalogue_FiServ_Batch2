Extract the Selenium Library in C:\FIServ-Automation\Jars\selenium-java-4.13.0

Now Open IntelliJIdea - Java Project --> Click on File --> Click on Project Structure --> Click on Modules --> Click on Dependencies
Click on + Add button --> Select Jars or Directories --> Browse the Above Selenium Libraries and Click on OK
--> Selenium Libraries will be added to the Project


WebDriver:
----------
==> WebDriver is an Interface
==> 												

												WebDriver(I)
													|	
				------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
				|					|					|					|					|				|
				ChromeDriver		FirefoxDriver		ChromiumDriver		EdgeDriver
				
Methods:
--------
1. void get(String URL); --> This method is used to load the Website
2. String getTitle(); --> This method is used to get the title of the Current Page
3. navigate().to(String url)--> This method is used to load the URL
4. void close() --> This method is used to close the browser
5. void quit() --> This method is used to close browser
6. manage().window().maximize() --> This method is used to maximize the browser window
7. String getCurrentURL() --> This method is used to get the Current URL of the application
8. String getPageSource() --> This method is used to get the page source of the application
9. navigate().forward() --> This method is used to move forward in the current browser window
10. navigate().back() --> This method is used to move backward in the current browser window
11. WebElement findElement(By by) --> This method is used to find the Element of a page/application
12. List<WebElement> findElements() --> This method is used to return the list of elements in a page/application
13. switchTO() --> This method is used to used to switch between the browser windows

12. getWindowHandle() --> This method is used to get the the current window Session ID
13. getWindowHandles() --> This method is used to return the number of windows which are opened by WebDriver



Difference between get() and navigate().to():
----------------------------------------------
==> Both get(String url) and navigate.to(String url) methods are used to load the given URL.
	When get() method is used, driver will wait till the complete page/application is loaded and then it moves to next step in the script
	When navigate().to() method is used, driver will not wait till the complete page/application is loaded. It just loads the url and moves to the next step in the script
	
Difference between close() and quit():
--------------------------------------
==>Both close() and quit() methods are used to close the browsers
	When close() method is used, driver will close the current window which is opened by WebDriver
	When quit() method is used, driver will close all the windows which are opened by WebDriver
	
Locators:
----------
==> There are '8' types of locators present in selenium
1. Name
2. ID
3. ClassName
4. LinkText
5. PartialLinkText
6. TagName
7. Xpath
8. CssSelector

Selenium WebDriver Locators:
----------------------------

ClassName :
-----------
By
1. By id(String args);
2. By name(String args);
3. By linkText(String args);
4. By partialLinkText(String args);
5. By className(String args);
6. By tagName(String args);
7. By xpath(String args);
8. By cssSelector(String args);

==>DOM --> Document Object Model --> Where all the WebElements/Objects are stored in a page

==> 1. Click on F12 button --> DOM will be opened
		(OR)
==> 2. Right click on a specific Element --> Click on Inspect option

WebElement
==> WebElement in Selenium is refers the HTML element in a DOM.
==> WebElement is a interface in Selenium

WebElement methods:
-------------------
1. public void sendKeys(CharSequence args0); --> This method is used to enter a text in an element (Ex: Text-box)
2. public void click(); --> This method is used to click on the element
3. public void clear(); --> This method is used to clear the text, if there is a text available in the element
4. public boolean isDisplayed(); --> This method is used to check whether element is displayed or not once element is found--> if element is not found, we will get NoSuchElementException
5. public boolean isEnabled(); --> This method is used to check whether element is enabled or not
6. public String getText(); --> This method is used to get the Text of a element
7. public void submit(); --> This method is used to submit a form to the remote server, if the current element is a form (OR) current element is available with in a form								 
8. public boolean isSelected(); --> This method is used to Determine whether element is selected or not
9. public String getAttribute(String args0); --> This method is used to get the value of a given Attribute of the element
10. public String getCssValue(String args0); --> This method is used to get the value of given CSS property
11. public String getTagName(); --> This method is used to return the tagName of a given element
12. public Point getLocation(); --> This method is used to get the Element Location where on the page
13. public Point getSize; --> This method is used to get the Element Size on the page

XPATH:
------
==> XPATH is also called as XML path
==> XML Path expression is used to find any kind of WebElement on web page uniqely using HTML page DOM.

Xpaths broadly divided into three categories:
-------------------------------------------
1. Absolute Xpath
2. Relative Xpath
3. Xpath with Attributes 

==> xpath with Attributes is the bestway --> If this way giving duplicate elements --> we need to write the relative xpath

How to write a Xpath?
---------------------
==> As a tester, If you want to write the xpath, you need to identify the starting point (tagname) and ending point (tagname) in HTML DOM
==> Once Identified the start point(tagName) and end point(tagName), traversing between the startpoint to endpoint will becomes xpath

==> Endpoint (tagName) is always constant. i.e., your highlighted element (which shows in blue color)
==> Startpoint(tagName) could be anywhere in the DOM. We need to identify the best optimized xpath when we identify the start point
==> Best Startpoint (tagName) will be identified with the experience

Absolute Xpath:
--------------
==> Starting point of the node is always constant for Absolute xpath i.e., html tagName
==> Ending point is always the highlighted webelement
==> traverse between your start point to endpoint will become your xpath


points to be considered while writing a xpath:
----------------------------------------------
1. If the same tagNames are repeated continuosly one parent, then count (number) should be appended after the tagName
2. Whenever traversing from one tagName to another tagName i.e., parent node to child node, we should use '/' should be used to distinguish the parent and child nodes


XPATH With Attributes:
----------------------
==> starting point and ending point of the node is always constant i.e., highlighted webelement

1. Xpath with single Attribute
------------------------------ 
Syntax:
		//htmltagName[@attributeType='attributeValue']
		
2. Xpath with multiple Attributes
------------------------------------
Syntax:		
		//htmltagName[@attributeType1='attributeValue1'][@attributeType2='attributeValue2']...........[@attributeTypeN='attributeValueN'] 
		
Relative XPATH:
---------------
==> In the Relative XPATH, starting point can be any node. best relative xpath can be written based on your experience
==> To Identify the starting point of the node, there are 'n' number of ways are available, can use anyone of the approach to identify the relative xpath of an WebElement


Syntax:
------
	//htmltagName[@attributename='attribtuteValue']/................/end point in the HTML (Highlighted line in the DOM)
	
CSS Selectors:
--------------
==> cssSelector is a path pattern that can use web element's attributes to locate a web element in the web page
==> cssSelector is very fast compared to Xpath, because Xpath engines are different in each browser. Therefore some times xpath are not suitable to identify element on IE and CSS is recommended for the same.

==> cssSelector is light weight compared to xpath and it is very straight forward
Limitation:
-----------
==> cssSelector locates the elements only in forward direction
==> Text attributes cannot be used in css selector

syntax:
-------
		htmlTagName[arritbuteType='attributeValue'] --> Single Attribute
		htmlTagName[arritbuteType1='attributeValue1'][arritbuteType2='attributeValue2'] --> with Multiple attributes
		
	Note:	==>	*[attributeName='attributeValue'] --> This will check for all the tags in the DOM
			==>	[attributeName='attributeValue'] --> Can write the cssSelector without TagName and HtmlTagName also
			
		Examples:
		1. input[name='q'] --> Google Search text-box
		2. input[name='txtPassword'][id='txtPassword'] --> password button in OrangeHRM
		
Using (#) Symbol:
-----------------
==> # Symbol is used along with the ID attribute to identify the web element in a web page

	Syntax:
	-----------
		"#attributeValue" --> will become your cssSelector
		
	Examples:
	---------
	1. #txtPassword --> Password in OrangeHRM
	2. #glow-ingress-line2 --> Select your Addresss link in Amazon
	3. input[name='txtUsername']#txtUsername --> UserName in OrangeHRM
	
Using (Dot) Symbol:
-------------------	
==> . Symbol is used along with the className attribute to identify the web element in a web page
	
	Syntax:
	-----------
		".attributeValue" --> will become your cssSelector
		
		
	Examples:
	---------
	==> .makeFlex.hrtlCenter.font10.makeRelative.lhUser.userLoggedOut --> Login or Create Acount button in Makemytrp website
	==> .top-level-menu-item.forced-active.active ==> Dashboard in OrangeHRM
	==> .css-label_c.t_c --> Flexible with Date in OrangeHRM
	
Execution Selenium Scripts in Multiple Browsers:
------------------------------------------------
1. Chrome Browser --> To run the testcases in Windows/Mac/Linux Operating Systems
	WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
	
2. Firefox Browser --> To run the testcases in Windows/Mac/Linux Operating Systems
	WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
	
3. Edge Browser --> To run the testcases in Windows operating System
	WebDriver driver = new EdgeDriver();

4. Safari Browser --> To run the testcases in Mac (iOS) operating System
	WebDriver driver = new SafariDriver();
	
5. IE Browser --> To run the testcases in Windows OS
	WebDriver driver = new InternetExplorerDriver();

6. Opera Browser --> In the Latest version of Selenium Library Opera browser is not supporting

Note: Browser Version should be compatible with Selenium Library version

=======================================================================================
			SELECTION of Values from a drop-down
1. Selection of drop-down values when Select tag is present in DOM
	Note:
		==> Select is a Pre-defined class in Selenium Library
		==> Select class of the Selenium Library will work only when drop-down tagName is started with Select tag
		
	Syntax:
	-------
		Select ob = new Select(WebElement);
Methods:
--------
1. selectByIndex(int index); This method is used based on the index value of the drop down
2. selectByValue(String value); This method is used to select the dropdown based on the value which is provided in the drop-down
3. selectByVisibleText(String Text); This method is used to select the dropdown based on the visible text.
4. isMultiple();  This method is used for verifying whether current dropdown is multi-select or single selection dropdown
5. deSelectByIndex(int index); Deselects the option at given index
6. deSelectByValue(String value);  Deselects the option that have a value matching the argument
7. deSelectByVisibleText(String text); Deselect the option that display text matching the argument
8. deSelectAll(); Cleard all selected values
9. getFirstSelectedOption(); Returns the First selected option as a WebElement
10. getAllSelectedOptions(); Returns all the selected options as a List of WebElements
11. getOptions(); This method Returns all the options in a dropdown as a List of WebElements
	

2. Selection of drop-down values when Select tag is not present in DOM

==> Select class of the Selenium Library will NOT work  when drop-down tagName is not started with Select tag
==> When Select tag is not present, Write a XPATH to get/retreive the group of WebElements by using "findElements" method
	List<WebElement> elements = driver.findElements(By.xpath("**********"));
	
==> Use the for-each loop and iterate over all the webelements and write a condition inside the loop to select the value from drop-down
	Example:
		for(WebElement element_location:elements_Locations){
            String location = element_location.getText();
            if(location.equalsIgnoreCase(TestData.orangeHRM_Location)){
                element_location.click();
                System.out.println("Location "+location+" is selected from the drop-down");
                break;
            }
        }
===========================================================================================================================================
									Handling iFrames in Selenium
==> iFrame is an HTML element that allows us to embed another HTML document within the current document
==> In General, iFrames creates rectrangular region on a webpage that displays the content from another source

There are '3' ways To Switch into the iFrame in Selenium
1. Switching into iFrame using Id (or) Name
2. Switching into iFrame using index 
3. Switching into iFrame using WebElement
	
Switching into iFrame using Id (or) Name:
-----------------------------------------
==> driver.switchTo().frame("Id (or) Name of the frame")

Switching into iFrame using index :
-----------------------------------
==> driver.switchTo().frame(Index position of the frame);

Switching into iFrame using WebElement:
---------------------------------------
WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.xpath("<iframe>"));
==> driver.switchTo().frame(WebElement);

==> Whenever If we want to interact any element presents outside the frame, we should exit/comeout from the frame
driver.switchTO().defaultContent();

=================================================================================================================================================
									Handling Alerts in Selenium
==> Alert is a pop-up (or) dialog-box that appears on a webapage to perform some user interaction
==> Typically these alerts will be triggered in the webapges when clicking on a button (or) while submitting a form

To Switching into the Alert:
----------------------------
	Alert al = driver.switchTo().alert();
	
	To Accept the alert --> al.accept();
	To cancel the alert --> al.dismiss();
	To enter the data into the alert --> al.sendKeys("<Data>");
	To retrieve the alert text --> al.getText()
	
	==> In Selenium alerts can be handled, if it has only less than 2 buttons and 1 text-box
===================================================================================================================================================
									Take Screenshots in Selenium 
==> TakeScreenshot is a Interface
==> TakeScreenshot is helpful in capturing the Screenshot
==> We need to explicitly performs driver Object into TakeScreenshot Object

Capturing the Screenshot:
-------------------------
TakeScreenshot ts = (TakeScreenshot) driver;
File src=ts.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE); // This method is used to capture the screenshot and stores in file variable
File dest = new File("<Path of the file>.jpg")
FileUtils.copyFile(src, dest);
====================================================================================================================================================
Robot:
------
==> Robot is a class in java.awt package;
==> Robot is a predefined class in Java.
==> By using Robot class, we can take the control of keyboard and mouse, so all Keyboard related activities and mouse related activities can be performed by using robot class.
==> Robot class is the last priority in using Selenium scripts because Robot class doesn't work in Remote machines (like Jenkins, Selenium Grid etc.,)

==> Robot r = new Robot();
Methods:
--------
1. keyPress --> This method is used to press the given key
2. keyRelease --> This method is used to release the given key
3. mousePress --> This method is used to press the mouse
4. mouseRelease --> This method is used to release the mouse
5. mouseWheel --> This method is used to scroll the mouse
