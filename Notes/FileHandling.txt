File Handling:
--------------

Java Streams:
-------------
==> A flow of data from source to destination is called as Stream
==> A source can be a keyboard, file, client, sever etc.,
==> A destination can be a monitor, file, client and server etc.,

==> In Java, Streams can be divided into '3' categories
1. Console Input/Output Stream
2. File Input/Output Stream
3. Network Input/Output Stream

******************************************
==> System.out.println();

class System{
		
		public static InputStream in;
		public static PrintStream out;
		public static PrintStream err;

}

class InputStream{

}

class PrintStream{
	public void println(int x){
		----------------
		----------------
	}
	
	public void println(char ch){
		----------------
		----------------
	}
	
	public void println(float f){
		----------------
		----------------
	}
}
**************************************************
==> All file related implementation classes are present in the java.io package

File Class Constructors and Methods:
------------------------------------
Constructors:
-------------
  public File(String); --> It will create a new file in the specified location
  public File(String, String); It creates a new File instance from a parent pathname string and a child pathname string.
  public File(File, String); It creates a new File instance from a parent abstract pathname and a child pathname string.
  public File(URI); --> It creates a new File instance by converting the given file: URI into an abstract pathname.
  
Methods:
-------
	public boolean createNewFile() throws java.io.IOException; --> 	It automically creates a new, empty file named by this abstract pathname if and only if a file with this name does not yet exist.
	public boolean canWrite(); --> It tests whether the application can modify the file
	public boolean canExecute(); --> It tests whether the application can execute the file denoted by this abstract pathname.
	public boolean canRead(); --> It tests whether the application can read the file 
	isAbsoulte() --> 	It tests whether this abstract pathname is absolute.
	iDirectory() -->	It tests whether the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a directory.
	isFile() --> It tests whether the file denoted by this abstract pathname is a normal file.
	
	getName() -> It returns the name of the file or directory denoted by this abstract pathname.
	getParent() --> It returns the pathname string of this abstract pathname's parent, or null if this pathname does not name a parent directory.
	toPath() --> It returns a java.nio.file.Path object constructed from the this abstract path.
	toURI() --> 	It constructs a file: URI that represents this abstract pathname.
	listFiles() --> It returns an array of abstract pathnames denoting the files in the directory denoted by this abstract pathname
	list(FilenameFilter filter) --> It returns an array of strings naming the files and directories in the directory
	mkdir()	 --> It creates the directory named by this abstract pathname.
	
/***** FileInputStream /FileOutputStream ********/
-----------------------------------------------------
==> FileInputStream --> Java FileInputStream class obtains input bytes from a file
==> FileInputStream class constructor is used to open the file in a read mode
It is used for reading byte-oriented data (streams of raw bytes) such as image data, audio, video etc. You can also read character-stream data. But, for reading streams of characters

Constructors:
-------------
==> public FileInputStream(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException; --> It opens a files for reading if file exists
Methods:
--------
1. int available() --> It is used to return the estimated number of bytes that can be read from the input stream.
2. int read() --> It is used to read the byte of data from the input stream.
3. int read(byte[] b) --> 	It is used to read up to b.length bytes of data from the input stream.
4. int read(byte[] b, int off, int len) --> t is used to read up to len bytes of data from the input stream.
5. void close() --> It is used to closes the stream
6. protected void finalize() --> It is used to ensure that the close method is call when there is no more reference to the file input stream.

Steps to read a file:
--------------------
1. open a file for reading
2. findout file size
3. Alocate the memory in a RAM according to file size
4. Read data from a file
5. Display data on a monitor
6. close file

==> FileOutputStream--> Java FileOutputStream is an output stream used for writing data to a file.
==> FileOutputStream class constructor is used to open the file in a Write mode

Constructor:
------------
==> public FileOutputStream(String fileName) throws FileNotFoundException;

Methods:
--------
1. void write(byte[] ary) -->	It is used to write ary.length bytes from the byte array to the file output stream.
2. void write(byte[] ary, int off, int len) --> It is used to write len bytes from the byte array starting at offset off to the file output stream.
3. void write(int b) -> It is used to write the specified byte to the file output stream.
4. void close() --> it closes a file

Steps to copy data from one file to another file using FileInputStream and FileOutputStream
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. open a file for reading
2. findout file size
3. Alocate the memory in a RAM according to file size
4. Read data from a file
5. Open another file for writing
6. Write data a file
7. close both the files


/***** Types of Streams *****************/
------------------------------------------
1. Byte Streams
2. Character Streams

==> Byte streams handles text, Image, graphics, animation, audio, video etc.,
==> Charcter streams handles only text

Hierarchy of ByteStream class:
------------------------------
															
															
															Object
																|
			-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			|																					|
		InputStream																				OutputStream
			|																						|
	---------------------------------------------												-------------------------------------------------
	|					|						|												|					|							|	
FileInputStream			FilterInputStream		ObjectInputStream								FileOutputStream	FilterOutputStream		ObjectOutputStream
								|																							|
							DataInputStream																		----------------------------
																												|							|
																										DataOutputStream					PrintStream
																										
==> DataInputStream and DataOutputStream classes support all PrimitiveDatatypes and String
==> ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream classes support Objects

Hierarchy of CharacterStream class:
-----------------------------------
															
															
															Object
																|
			-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			|																					|
		Reader																					Writer
			|																						|
	---------------------------											----------------------------------------------------
	|					|												|					|							|	
BufferReader		InputStreamReader								BufferedWriter	OutputStreamWriter				PrintWriter
						|																		|
						FileReader																FileWriter
						
ObjectInputStream:
------------------
==> It is used to read an Object from file (or) network

ObjectOutputStream:
-------------------
==> It is used to write an Object into a file (or) network

==> java.io.ObjectInputStream:
------------------------------
Constructor:
	public ObjectInputStream(InputStream) throws IOException;
	
Methods:
--------
	public final Object readObject() throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;
	public void close() throws IOException
	
==> java.io.ObjectOutputStream:
------------------------------
Constructor:
	public ObjectOutputStream(outputstream) throws IOException;
	
Methods:
--------
	public final void writeObject() throws IOException;
	public void close() throws IOException
				
Serialization:
==============
==> It is a process of converting Object into series of bits
==> In Java, Object must be serializable to do the following actions
	1. Writing object to a file
	2. Reading object from a file
	3. Writing object to a network
	4. Reading Object from network
	
==> Classs must be marked with "java.io.Serializable" interface to make serializable object
==> "java.io.Serializable" is called as marker interface (or) empty interface, because no members present in this interface
